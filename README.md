### Motivation
Generic status bars provide superior customization for the price of complexity, but I've always wanted a BSPWM bar that just works out-of-the-box.

### Features
* Listens to BSPWM events directly via Unix socket, i.e. instant updates
* Focused desktop window count widget, no more getting lost in monocle mode
* Urgent desktop support
* All widgets are written in Rust â€“ forget slow scripts
* First class multi-monitor support
* In-built desktop, node count, active node name, network, cpu, mem, storage, battery, clock widgets.

### Install
#### AUR
`paru -S krowbar`

#### Cargo
`cargo install krowbar`

### Setup
Add this to your `bspwmrc`:
```
# Kill krowbar, when restarting BSPWM. Allows for quick iteration, if configuring.
killall krowbar

# Regular BSPWM monitor setup, krowbar will use these as dekstop names
bspc monitor {your-monitor-name} -d web code III IV V VI

# Start krowbar
krowbar &
```

### You should try out krowbar if you:
- Skipped on BSPWM, because it has no default status bar
- Are drowning in semi-working configuration
- Need a decently looking, functional status bar while searching for a nice [eww](https://github.com/elkowar/eww) config in [/r/unixporn](https://www.reddit.com/r/unixporn/)
- Always wanted something akin to [i3status](https://i3wm.org/docs/i3status.html) but for BSPWM

### TODO
- Prepare arch release
